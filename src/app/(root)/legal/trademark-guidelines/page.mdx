ENS Labs built and shared the open-source ENS protocol, which creates a decentralized naming system for Ethereum. Anyone can check out, tweak, or build on the code thanks to its open-source licenses—but those licenses don't cover our trademarks.

Keeping our branding clear helps users know when something's officially backed by ENS. If you're planning to use ENS logos or names, you'll need to stick to the official trademark rules.

Like other projects that create open-source software, we enforce our trademark rights to protect our community and maintain trust in the ENS ecosystem.

We believe in working together and welcome anyone who wants to help push the ENS ecosystem forward. To keep things growing while also safeguarding the ENS brand, we let contributors, developers, and partners use our marks as long as they follow certain rules. These rules are there to protect the ENS brand, its community, and the ecosystem overall, while making sure the marks are used responsibly and openly.

If you use any ENS trademarks, you're agreeing to follow these guidelines and any instructions that come with them. ENS reserves the right to take action to protect its trademarks and the ENS community.

These guidelines might change occasionally, so it's up to you to keep up with the latest version. If you don't agree with what's outlined here, don't download or use the trademarks.

## The ENS Marks

This policy applies to all of our trademarks and service marks, whether registered or not, including, among others:

### 1. Word Marks

- ENS™
- Namechain™

### 2. ENS Logos, Descriptive and Figurative Marks (in any of our colours)

<div className='not-prose space-y-4 pl-2'>
  <div className='flex items-center gap-2'>
    <img src="/assets/brand/logo/ens-logo-Blue.svg" alt="ENS Logo" className='h-8' />
    <span>Main Icon</span>
  </div>

  <div className='flex items-center gap-2'>
    <img src="/assets/brand/token-icon.svg" alt="Token Icon" className='h-12' />
    <span>The icon used to represent ENS as an avatar and the $ENS token</span>
  </div>
</div>

Remember, you can't use any trademarks, logos, or branding that aren't specifically listed in these Guidelines or the Marks List without getting permission from ENS first. 

## Acceptable Uses

**You're free to do any of the following without asking us first**, as long as you don't (in ENS's opinion) hurt the ENS brand, make it seem less valuable, or harm the ENS community:

- **Use the ENS name/logos** to honestly talk about or link to the original, unmodified ENS software, protocols, or services.
- **Use the ENS name/logos** to describe your own modified versions of ENS tech- like saying, *"This is based on ENS software"* or *"This service uses ENS tech."* But you **must** also clearly state something like: *"\[Your Brand\] isn't officially connected to or endorsed by ENS Labs".*
- **Use the ENS name/logos** to make it super clear that your project isn't affiliated with or backed by ENS Labs.
- **Use the ENS name/logos** in apps or protocols that work with ENS, as long as you're accurately referring to (and linking, if possible) the real ENS tech on Ethereum or other blockchains.

## Using ENS Trademarks – What You Need to Know

Before you use ENS trademarks, make sure you have permission. Here are some things that need approval:

- **Selling Stuff**: If you want to use ENS trademarks to sell products or services, you need to get written permission from ENS first.
- **Making Merch**: If you're making items with ENS trademarks (like t-shirts, mugs, or hardware wallets), you need a license. ENS must approve all vendors must be approved, even if you're giving items away for free.
- **Marketing and Sponsorships**: If you're using ENS trademarks for fundraising, ads, or promotions that aren't for ENS directly, you need written approval.
- **Company Names**: You can't use ENS trademarks in your company name (like "ENS Solutions Ltd.") without permission.
- **Education and Training**: If you want to use ENS trademarks in educational materials like textbooks or courses, you need approval.
- **Online Presence**: Using "ENS" or related names in domain names, email addresses, or social media handles (like "@ENSOfficial" or "ensmarketplace.com") requires permission.
- **Collaborations and Endorsements**: If third parties want to use ENS trademarks in promotions, sponsorships, or endorsements, they need explicit approval to avoid implying that ENS endorses them.

If you need more info or want to chat about using our trademarks, just reach out to us at [legal@ens.domains](mailto:legal@ens.domains).

We can assess how you plan to use our trademarks anytime and can help find a way forward if your proposal doesn't fit these guidelines or seems inappropriate for any other reason.

## Proper Usage of ENS Labs Trademark

When using ENS trademarks, it is important to follow these simple rules:

- **Use Them Correctly**: Always spell and display ENS trademarks exactly as they appear in the Marks List. Don't change their look unless you're scaling them. Avoid misspelling, translating, hyphenating, or combining them with other words. Keep the original wording and design intact.
- **Logo Use**: If you're using an ENS logo, give it some space from other elements on your webpage or document so it's easy to read. Make sure the logos are sharp and look great. Use ENS trademarks as adjectives, not nouns or verbs, and never in plural or possessive forms. Always pair them with a generic term for the ENS product or service (like "ENS protocol" or "ENS domains").
- **Give Credit**: When you can, include a clear trademark notice the first time you mention the mark on a webpage, document, or documentation. For example, say "ENS is a trademark of ENS Labs."
- **Use the Right Symbols**: Properly mark the status of the trademark using the correct symbol (either ® or TM).

These guidelines are crucial for keeping ENS trademarks strong and recognizable. Always use them properly to help protect the ENS brand and its community.

## Improper Usage of ENS Trademark

Here's a plain-English breakdown of how not to use ENS trademarks:

- **Don't claim ENS as yours:** Avoid using "ENS" in your project or business names, smart contracts, publications, apps, social media handles, or domains. Example: *"ENS-Tools"* is a no-go, but *"Works with ENS"* is fine.
- **No knockoffs:** Steer clear of names/logos that look or sound like ENS branding.
- **Keep it balanced:** Don't make ENS branding bigger or flashier than your own product name.
- **Leave the logo alone:** Don't tweak, mash up, or slap ENS marks on merch (like t-shirts) without permission.
- **No false endorsements:** Don't imply ENS backs your project (e.g., *"Official ENS Partner"*). Neutral phrasing like *"ENS Fan Page"* is okay.
- **Skip shady contexts:** No gambling, adult content, or illegal stuff paired with ENS branding. Also banned: ICOs, airdrops, crypto sales, meme coins, mixers, and any kind of money transmission.
