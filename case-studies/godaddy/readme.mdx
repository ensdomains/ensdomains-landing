### Summary

Here you will learn how GoDaddy partnered with ENS to bring crypto wallet functionality to traditional DNS domains.

GoDaddy has integrated with ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to make DNS domains like **.com**, **.org**, **.ai**, and **.xyz** function as crypto wallet addresses. With ENS's Gasless DNSSEC upgrade ([ENSIP-17](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/ensip-17)), GoDaddy offers a one-click "Crypto Wallet" record that transforms a customer's existing DNS domain into a fully functional ENS name.

This integration combines legacy DNS infrastructure with decentralized naming, enabling millions of users to participate in Web3 using their existing domains. Users can send and receive cryptocurrency directly to their DNS domains like `coolexample.com`, instead of using complex hexadecimal addresses like `0xabc…123`.

The partnership demonstrates how traditional Web2 infrastructure can seamlessly integrate with Web3 technologies, preserving existing functionality while adding blockchain capabilities.

### Why GoDaddy Integrated with ENS

Crypto wallet addresses are inherently complex and difficult to share. ENS solved this back in 2017 by turning these complicated addresses into human-readable names with the `.eth` suffix.

ENS has expanded the domain ecosystem by adding crypto-friendly functionalities to traditional DNS domains (`.com`, `.io`, `.finance`, and more) while supporting both forward and reverse resolution.

During the rise of various Web3 naming services, legacy DNS domains remained siloed and excluded from this development. ENS's gasless DNSSEC upgrade presents an opportunity for the traditional domain space to join this evolution.

GoDaddy's integration serves several key purposes:

1. **Simplified Crypto Transactions:** Customers can use their existing domains as wallet addresses instead of complex hexadecimal strings.
2. **Preserved Brand Identity:** Organizations maintain their established domain names while gaining Web3 capabilities.
3. **Reduced Friction:** One-click integration removes technical barriers for mainstream adoption.
4. **Dual Functionality:** Domains retain full DNS functionality (hosting, email) while gaining onchain resolution.

### How It Works

**Important:** When a user imports a traditional DNS domain such as `coolexample.com` with ENS via DNSSEC, they are **not** granted a corresponding `.eth` name. The integration simply extends the existing domain with blockchain resolution capabilities.

The same domain name functions in both the legacy DNS system and the ENS namespace:
- **DNS functionality:** Traditional web hosting, email, and other DNS services continue unchanged
- **ENS functionality:** The domain can now resolve to Ethereum addresses and other blockchain records

After enabling DNSSEC and linking the domain, `coolexample.com` resolves not only to its traditional web endpoints but also directly to an Ethereum address. This dual functionality coexists seamlessly without altering the domain's primary DNS identity.

Because the integration uses DNSSEC proofs to delegate resolution to the ENS Public Resolver, there is no conflict or duplication with any `.eth` name. The domain retains its original namespace and gains onchain wallet and identity features as a first-class citizen in the ENS ecosystem.

### Architecture & Implementation

GoDaddy's integration with ENS is built on three core infrastructure components:

#### DNSSEC (GoDaddy)
At the heart of the integration lies the DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC). DNSSEC creates a cryptographic chain-of-trust for all DNS records. GoDaddy automates both the generation and rollover of DNSSEC key pairs, ensuring the data remains signed and verifiable without creating operational burdens for users.

#### ENS Resolver
When DNSSEC is enabled, the domain's TXT records containing the mapping from the DNS name to its Ethereum address are stored onchain within the ENS registry. The ENS resolver fetches and interprets these onchain records, enabling both forward (name → address) and reverse (address → name) resolution.

#### Gasless DNSSEC (ENSIP-17)
In February 2024, ENS introduced ENSIP-17: Gasless DNS Resolution. This upgrade allows the ENS resolver to read offchain DNSSEC proofs at lookup time without requiring gas fees, making the integration cost-effective for users.

### User Experience

GoDaddy customers can enable crypto wallet functionality for their domains through a simple one-click process in their domain management dashboard. The "Crypto Wallet" record transforms their existing DNS domain into a fully functional ENS name without requiring:

- Additional domain registration
- Gas fees for setup
- Technical knowledge of blockchain infrastructure
- Changes to existing DNS functionality

This seamless integration allows organizations and individuals to leverage their existing brand identity while participating fully in the crypto ecosystem.

### Key Benefits

- **No Separate Registration:** Users don't need to register additional `.eth` names
- **Cost-Effective:** Gasless DNSSEC eliminates transaction fees
- **Brand Preservation:** Existing domain identity remains intact
- **Dual Functionality:** Traditional DNS and blockchain resolution coexist
- **Mainstream Adoption:** Simplified onboarding for Web2 users

By preserving the original domain and layering on ENS's blockchain resolution capabilities, GoDaddy's approach enables millions of domain owners to enter the Web3 space without abandoning their established digital identities.

### About GoDaddy

GoDaddy is the world's largest domain registrar, powering over 84 million domains with reliable hosting, email and DNS services. Known for its user-friendly tools and robust infrastructure, GoDaddy leads the industry in bringing blockchain naming to its customers, seamlessly merging traditional domains with Ethereum Name Service (ENS).

### About ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized, public, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS connects human-readable names like 'nick.eth' to cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, smart contracts, and metadata. Name registration is done through smart contracts, and although ENS names work across various different chains like Bitcoin and Solana, name ownership is secured by the Ethereum blockchain.
