Starting today, ENS can connect with any DNS domain<sup>1</sup> for free.

## History

ENS has always been complementary to existing internet infrastructure. For years, DNS names could be imported into ENS without a protocol fee, but incurred hefty Ethereum gas fees, in some cases reaching 0.5 ETH.

The reason behind the high fee is that a large amount of data (DNSSEC proof) needed to be saved to the Ethereum blockchain to prove ownership of a domain. While this remains an option, interacting with the blockchain is no longer a required step in crypto-enabling a DNS name.

## How It Works

Gasless DNSSEC is powered by [CCIP Read (EIP-3668)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668), an application-level standard for Ethereum smart contracts to fetch and verify offchain data. It was authored by Nick Johnson, the Founder and Lead Developer of ENS Labs.

In [EP5.1](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/4208408830555077285685632645423534041634535116286721240943655761928631543220), ENS DAO approved the activation of a new smart contract that implements CCIP Read at the DNS TLD level. Having CCIP Read at the TLD level means that DNS records can be verified on-demand via an offchain gateway. The result is a free way to use DNS domains in the ENS ecosystem.

## How To Use It

Configuring your DNS name to work with ENS can be accomplished in a few simple steps:

- Enable DNSSEC
- Add a TXT record in the format `ENS1 <ens-resolver-address>`
- Done! Now your DNS name can be resolved according to whichever ENS resolver you specified. [Try it here](https://ens-resolution.vercel.app/).

For the easiest experience, we've created a special resolver that can read an Ethereum address from the same TXT record. The format is `ENS1 dnsname.ens.eth <eth-address>`.

<sup>1</sup> Any DNS name where the TLD supports [DNSSEC](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en)
and uses the official ENS DNSRegistrar smart contract.
