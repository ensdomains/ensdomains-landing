      ENS has always been about making onchain interactions simpler and more secure. What started as a solution to replace complex wallet addresses with human-readable names has evolved into the identity infrastructure of web3. Today, we're announcing ENS App and ENS Explorer, two dedicated experiences that represent the next chapter in that evolution.

#### Two Products, One Vision	

With [ENSv2](/ensv2) and the upcoming launch of Namechain, our new Layer 2 purpose-built for identity, we will be unveiling two focused products each tailored to the diverse needs of our users: 

**ENS App:** A streamlined consumer product for newcomers and everyday users focused on seamless name registration and identity management.

**ENS Explorer:** A comprehensive developer tool for ecosystem builders, featuring advanced ownership capabilities, custom resolvers, and detailed historical records that offers complete visibility with precise controls.

#### Why now?

When ENS first launched, we built exactly what the ecosystem needed: human-readable names for wallet addresses, with tools designed for the builders who were laying the UX foundation of web3. As we added functionality, each new feature found its home within our single Manager app. This approach served our early community of technical users who wanted access to everything ENS could do – from adding an avatar to their ENS profiles to customizing permissions on a name.

But communities grow, and ours has expanded far beyond those early builders who helped to bring us to where we are now. Today's ENS users include everyone from crypto newcomers claiming their first digital identity to enterprises like [PayPal](https://ens.domains/ecosystem/paypal) and [GoDaddy](https://ens.domains/ecosystem/godaddy), bringing web3 to their millions of mainstream users. Each group has fundamentally different needs, and they deserve tools built specifically for them.

#### Designing by Subtraction, Designing by Addition

The new ENS App succeeds through designing by subtraction: the art of intentionally removing complexity to create focused, delightful experiences. Every feature decision asks: "Does this help someone discover, claim, or express their identity?" If not, it doesn't belong here. The result is intuitive flows sprinkled with moments of joy that make claiming and curating a web3 identity feel welcoming and effortless. 

The new ENS Explorer succeeds through designing by addition—embracing granularity and transparency that builders demand. This is where protocol depth lives: complete data access, advanced analytics, comprehensive search and filtering, and the advanced, enriched tooling that gives developers confidence in ENS as their source of truth.

#### Meeting Our Users Where They Are

ENS remains what it has always been: the bridge between human-readable identity and blockchain infrastructure. Every user starts on the same bridge by claiming their identity, and now users have more options for how they want to continue their journey depending on their goals. The ENS protocol stays neutral, while the user experiences become specialized. With opinionated product design, each tool excels in its own domain while staying tethered to the same decentralized infrastructure. 

This evolution reflects something fundamental about ENS: we've always been a UX protocol first, here to serve our users. As our community has grown from hundreds to millions, so too must our tools. ENSv2 represents our commitment to meeting every user where they are, whether they're taking their first steps into web3 identity or building the infrastructure that will onboard the next billion users.

#### This is just the beginning of what's possible.
