[Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS), a universal standard for naming and identity based on the Ethereum blockchain, has joined the [Project Liberty Alliance](https://www.projectliberty.io/alliance/). This is a collection of over 100 organizations supporting [Project Liberty](https://www.projectliberty.io/)’s mission of building a people-powered internet. As one of the first crypto companies to join the Alliance, ENS is positioned as a key supporter of [The People’s Bid For TikTok](https://www.thepeoplesbid.com/)**.**

ENS and Project Liberty see a future where social networks exist on the [Decentralized Social Networking Protocol](https://dsnp.org/) (DSNP), similar to how Web2 is built on HTTP. DSNP links the consensus layer, such as a public blockchain, with social apps and websites. This allows users to control and revoke their data on a per-application basis.

Content creators are currently in a holding pattern with the ban on TikTok having been paused until Saturday, April 12, 2025\. The People’s Bid aims to give creators self-sovereignty, as opposed to having no choice but to be dependent on government protection of the platform or who ByteDance decides to sell to.

_“Whether Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal or the current indecision around TikTok in the US, we as consumers know that our personal data is valuable, but still don’t have control over how that data is used. By migrating TikTok to a new infrastructure, people, not only corporations, governments, or algorithms, would have the agency to shape their digital experience. We felt it was valuable to have ENS, a core Ethereum identity protocol, alongside this broad consortium of prominent technologists, academic institutions, policymakers, and civic organizations to help shape the future of a user owned social platform,”_ said [**James Beck**](https://x.com/jamesjohnbeck?lang=en)**, Head of Growth at ENS Labs**, the organization behind the open-source blockchain naming protocol Ethereum Name Service (ENS).

The People’s Bid For TikTok is the first time a Web3 protocol has been involved in conversations to buy a Web2 entity. Overcoming network effects has been a major obstacle to Web3 adoption. This acquisition represents a unique opportunity to bridge Web3 technology with TikTok's established user base and introduce regular consumers to a new paradigm of social, where users have more choice, voice, and a share in the economic value they create online.

ENS will also be collaborating with [**Frequency Network**](https://www.frequency.xyz/), the core infrastructure for Project Liberty’s “People’s Bid” to acquire TikTok U.S., and in the coming weeks, find areas of standardization around profile names in DSNP and integration with the ENS standard.
