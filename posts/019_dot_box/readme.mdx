In a groundbreaking move for the world of web3, ENS Labs has partnered with Intercap to bring .box domains to the ENS Manager App, marking the first time an ICANN approved top-level domain (TLD) has been integrated in this dynamic platform.
This collaboration marks a significant leap forward in uniting traditional web and blockchain technologies, seamlessly bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 with innovative ease.

## What Does .box Bring to the Table?

.box domains are unique in that they operate onchain, blending the established features of DNS with the decentralized ethos of ENS. This means that .box domains serve not only as web addresses and email hosts but also as your personal, cross-platform Web3 identity.


Key Features of .box Domains:

- **Web3 Identity**: Each .box domain acts as a universal username across the decentralized internet, facilitated by ENS.
- **Tokenized Domain**: In partnership with 3DNS, .box brings the traditional domain into the blockchain era, offering tokenized domain names.
- **Website and Email Functionality**: Enabled by ICANN DNS resolution, ensuring that .box domains function comparably to their traditional counterparts.
- **NFT Ownership**: .box domains are controlled and owned as NFTs on the Optimism network, emphasizing user autonomy and security.

## The Importance of DNS TLDs Importing to ENS Protocol

The integration of traditional DNS TLDs like .box into the ENS protocol is pivotal, driving the growth of ENS and increasing its adoption.
This strategic expansion makes Web3 technologies accessible and familiar to a broader audience, thereby encouraging the transition from Web2 to Web3.

- **Familiarity Breeds Adoption**: Users accustomed to the traditional internet structure find the transition to Web3 more intuitive with familiar TLDs, thus accelerating adoption.
- **Expanding Functional Capabilities**: Integrating DNS TLDs enhances the functionality of ENS, allowing users to enjoy both decentralized benefits and traditional domain utilities like websites and emails.
- **Strengthening Network Effects**: As more DNS TLDs become part of the ENS ecosystem, the network's value and interconnectivity grow, attracting more users and developers.
- **Catalyzing Technological Convergence**: This integration marks a significant step in the convergence of centralized and decentralized web services, showcasing a shift towards a user-centric internet model.

## Economic Implications and Future Development

For each .box domain registered through the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app), ENS DAO receives a referral fee, which is channeled back into the continuous development of both the ENS and wider Web3 ecosystems.
This not only fosters sustainability but also propels further innovation within the space.

## Industry Leaders Weigh In

Josh Brandley, the founder of .box domains, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership: "ENS stands as the preeminent naming protocol in the Web3 ecosystem.
As we look to the future, we are convinced the demand for Web3 usernames will vastly surpass that for traditional web domains.
We are thrilled to collaborate with ENS Labs to push the boundaries of web3 naming capabilities."

Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, also commented on the integration: ".box truly understands the Web3 vision and has taken bold steps to create a TLD that bridges Web2 and Web3 worlds seamlessly.
It's a pleasure to integrate .box into our manager, offering ENS users another robust option for their domain needs."
