ENS names have always been the key to a more user-friendly and intuitive web3 experience. Today, we're taking that a step further. With our latest integration with [Para](https://www.getpara.com/), users can now register an ENS name using just an email address, social login, or a phone number.

### Why Para?

The selection of Para emerged from a comprehensive technical and strategic evaluation conducted by the ENS Labs team. Para is a wallet and authentication suite, designed to make interacting with web3 applications simple and secure. Para's embedded wallets leverage distributed multi-party computation (MPC) and passkeys which allows users to sign into apps with nothing more than an email or phone number. Unlike other embedded wallet solutions, Para wallets are universal and portable, so users can carry the same wallet across multiple applications instead of creating a new one for each app they interact with.

The universality of Para's embedded wallets makes them an ideal partner in our mission to make ENS names available to anyone, regardless of their familiarity with crypto wallets or where they want to use their ENS name.

### What This Means for ENS Users

Our integration with Para makes acquiring and using an ENS name easier than ever. Now, users visiting [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains) can select Para as a wallet option when registering, removing the need for a browser-extension based wallet. If you already have an ENS name, Para ensures your ENS name is displayed instead of a long, complex wallet address, improving usability across applications. With an email or social login, registering an ENS name becomes instant, simplifying web3 onboarding for new users.

ENS has always been at the forefront of decentralized identity, providing a simple, universal naming system for blockchain users. With over **2 million names registered** and more than **850,000 unique owners**, we are committed to reducing barriers and making ENS more accessible. This integration allows anyone, regardless of their technical background, to register and manage an ENS name and enjoy the benefits of a global, portable form of identity, all without needing a traditional wallet.

For existing ENS name holders, you can choose the 'Connect Wallet' option and connect with your existing name. If you don't have a browser extension based wallet, Para provides a seamless way to sign in and manage your ENS identity. When using apps that support Para, your ENS name will now be displayed instead of a wallet address, making transactions and interactions more intuitive. You can also use the ENS Manager at [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains) to update records, set primary names, and explore new ways to leverage your ENS identity.

### Get Started Today

This integration isn't just about adding another wallet option, it's about bringing more people into web3 by making ENS names easier to obtain and use. By removing friction and improving accessibility, we're opening the door for millions of new users to experience decentralized identity. We're excited to support Para in their mission to onboard the next wave of web3 users.
