ENS is excited to present [frENSday](https://frensday.ens.domains/), the premier event kicking off [DevConnect 2023](https://devconnect.org/) in the vibrant city of Istanbul, Türkiye. This one-day event gives us a chance to create a gathering for like-minded pioneers, innovators and enthusiasts to join us IRL, so you won't want to miss it! If you're unable to join IRL don't worry, we're working to make sure all sessions are live streamed, recorded and distributed to our global audience.

## Istanbul: Where East Meets West

The city's rich history and cultural blend make it the perfect backdrop for a conference focused on bridging communities. Türkiye has recently become a leader in crypto adoption, making Istanbul a hub for blockchain innovation. We're excited for DevConnect to be taking place in Istanbul and for the opportunity to make the event accessible to the local community!

## What is frENSday?

Born out of a request from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/), frENSday is an initiative led by [ENS](https://ens.domains/) to create an inclusive and transformative space for the Ethereum, ENS and wider Web3 ecosystems and communities. But it's not just another tech conference; it's a mission. A mission to bridge communities, build the future and explore the untapped potential of decentralized technologies.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the Ethereum ecosystem, frENSday offers something for everyone. The event promises a fusion of engaging talks, workshops and some big announcements! We also hope that you walk away with some new frens you can collaborate, build and contribute to the future of Web3 with.

With an expected turnout of 1500-2000 attendees from all over the world, frENSday is set to be a global affair. We're planning for an event that can cater to a mixed audience, from developers to Web3 enthusiasts or those brand new to Web3 - there'll be something for everyone.

## The Agenda: More Than Just Talks

frENSday isn't just a one-day conference; it's a springboard to a whole week of independently organized Ethereum events under the banner of DevConnect 2023. This week-long gathering is designed to enable community members to learn, share and build together. With other events like [ETHGlobal Istanbul](https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul) offering a prize pool of up to $500,000, there's something to keep everyone engaged and motivated. We're excited for the opportunity to provide teams with a space to meet, learn and prepare for EthGlobal via their frENSday experience.

## Tracks at frENSday
